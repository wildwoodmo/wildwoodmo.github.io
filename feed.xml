        <title>Wildwood&apos;s Attack on Christmas - Lighting Ordinance Coincides with Global Eclipse Celebrations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wildwood, April 6, 2024&lt;/strong&gt; - In a move that has sparked widespread debate and captured the attention of holiday enthusiasts and civil liberty groups alike, the City of Wildwood is poised to lead an unprecedented charge against traditional Christmas celebrations. The city council is scheduled to vote on a highly contentious holiday lighting ordinance this Monday, April 8th, a day when the rest of the world will be turning its eyes skyward to witness a rare and spectacular solar eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed ordinance seeks to impose strict limitations on the use of holiday lighting and decorations by residents and businesses within city limits, citing energy conservation and light pollution as the primary motivators for the legislation. Critics, however, argue that the timing of the ordinance, coupled with its stringent regulations, amounts to an outright assault on the spirit of Christmas and the personal freedoms of Wildwood’s inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t just about lights; it’s about our right to celebrate and express joy during one of the most cherished times of the year,” stated Chris Hammond, a local resident and vocal opponent of the ordinance. “The fact that this vote is happening while the world celebrates unity and wonder during the eclipse only adds insult to injury.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst this already heated debate, some see the ordinance as part of a broader pattern of attacks on Christmas traditions. There is growing concern among residents that such regulatory measures could extend beyond lighting to other aspects of holiday celebrations, further diminishing the season’s joy and community spirit. This perspective fuels fears that the cherished festive ambiance of Wildwood could be irreversibly changed, leaving a colder, less welcoming community environment in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition of the ordinance vote with the global celebration of the eclipse has only heightened tensions within the community. While many cities around the world are hosting special events and viewing parties to commemorate the celestial event, Wildwood’s focus on domestic policy has placed it at the center of a heated debate on individual freedoms versus excessive government regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Monday approaches opponents of the ordinance are mobilizing. The outcome of the vote is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the eyes of Wildwood, and perhaps the world, will be on the city council chambers this Monday, even as the skies darken and the stars align for a moment of astronomical wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cityofwildwood.com/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Item/39092?fileID=46768&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR05IvRqjzQ9hrDfD3chjPJ_zDUTkEWgaMMdV8Zgc-o9wKl_DR6oFMwVTQA_aem_AaG7xYZyqrNxGs5v-8FS24lvDe1qRllBaFUtmRe7zxM9PssCeL8el2f_85KBMUVIPMXn-vFrggRDNYoa_9-j70Fi&quot;&gt;You can read the ordinance here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Monday, April 8, 2024 6:30 P.M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cityofwildwood.com/150/City-Council&quot;&gt;Find them listed here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-472024&quot;&gt;Update 4/7/2024&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is that an ammendmant will be introduced to limit this to only multifamily properties (apartments) and remove the Kelvin restrictions. No guarantees that happens or passes, so continue to fight against the changes to the ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-4102024&quot;&gt;Update 4/10/2024&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City Council shot down both the original ordinance and the amended version on Monday night. Lights are safe in Wildwood, for now. Unless of course you’re a high school (or any business) and want to put up an LED sign. The city won’t allow that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Roundabout at Wildhorse Creek and Highway 109</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) has unveiled plans for a significant infrastructure project aimed at enhancing traffic flow and safety in St. Louis County. Central to this initiative is the construction of a two-lane roundabout at the bustling intersection of Route 109 and Route CC. This development comes in response to the area’s growth and the resulting increase in traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-choice-of-a-roundabout&quot;&gt;The Choice of a Roundabout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roundabouts are celebrated for their efficiency and safety benefits. By reducing conflict points and encouraging a continuous flow of traffic, they significantly lower the chances of accidents while easing vehicle movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;anticipated-community-benefits&quot;&gt;Anticipated Community Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is expected to yield numerous advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Travel Times:&lt;/strong&gt; Streamlining the flow of traffic to minimize delays.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Vehicle Emissions:&lt;/strong&gt; Less idling means a decrease in exhaust emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Safety:&lt;/strong&gt; A safer environment for motorists and pedestrians alike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;embracing-the-future&quot;&gt;Embracing the Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduled to begin in Spring 2024, the construction phase will undoubtedly introduce temporary changes to daily commutes. However, the focus remains on the long-term gains: a more efficient, safer, and environmentally friendly transportation network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay updated on this transformative project by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modot.org/missouri-route-109-and-route-cc-intersection-improvements-st-louis&quot;&gt;MoDOT’s official project page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kayaking Near Wildwood, Missouri</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am looking to start kayaking around the Wildwood area, where is what I have found so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meramec River: The Meramec River is a popular spot for paddlers near Wildwood, MO. It offers opportunities for both calm paddling or more challenging rapids for the more experienced. Check local outfitters for rentals and guided trips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missouri River: This iconic river flows through the state and offers many opportunities for kayaking. It could be suitable for more experienced paddlers due to its size and current.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creve Coeur Lake: If you are looking for a more relaxed environment, Creve Coeur Lake is nearby and offers kayaking. It’s a great place for beginners and families.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Castlewood State Park: This park is located near Wildwood and is known for hiking and mountain biking but may also offer some opportunities for kayaking.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Local Outfitters and Kayak Tours: Often, local outfitters will have the best and most current information on kayaking in the area. They can provide rentals, safety gear, and guided tours that match your skill level and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always remember to follow local regulations, respect private property, and practice safe kayaking by wearing a life jacket and being aware of weather and water conditions. It might be a good idea to check with local outdoor recreation stores or community groups for the most up-to-date information on where to kayak near Wildwood, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;News on the morning of April 20th is saying that there was a shooting at Larry’s Tavern in Wildwood late on 4/19/2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details are sparse, but it apparently was outside, with two dead. Possibly a 51 year old male, killed a 40 year old male, then turn the gun on himself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rockwood Board Of Education Election April 5th, 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for information on the candidates for Rockwood School District in Missouri’s election to the board of education on April 5th, 2022, look no further!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything you need to know is in this graphic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/rsdmocandidates.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;April 5th Candidates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyurl.com/2p8wdec4&quot;&gt;Watch the League Of Women Voters Candidate Forum&lt;/a&gt; an informative session of 4 of the 5 candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rnea.org/&quot;&gt;More info about the Rockwood NEA - Rockwood National Education Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research the candidates. Make the right decision for Rockwood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vote for Stine and Ryan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- If you think CRT is in our schools, and is the biggest threat to our schools, you&apos;re paranoid and need to actually do some research to understand that Rockwood doesn&apos;t use, or plan to use, CRT. 

CRT is a right wing scare tactic that people who like to ban books use to get you worked up over issues that don&apos;t exist. --&gt;

        <title>Bicycling in Wildwood Missouri</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for places to ride your bike near St. Louis, you will be hard pressed to find a better area for all types of riding than Wildwood, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mountain-biking&quot;&gt;Mountain Biking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best mountain biking in the St. Louis area can be found right here in Wildwood. Be sure to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://gorctrails.com/trails/bluff-view&quot;&gt;Bluff View, Zombie, Rock Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gorctrails.com/trails/greensfelder&quot;&gt;Greensfelder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GORC (Gateway Off-road Cyclists) has really put in a lot of effort into the park at Bluff View and is currently building out new trails and kids trails there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;road-cycling&quot;&gt;Road Cycling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for beautiful roads to ride your road or tri bike on, Wildwood is the place for you! We’ve got plenty of hills with climbs to earn your descents. You can easily get one thousand feed of climbing in with a 10 mile route or even more climbing for longer routes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the safest places to ride your road bike include Centaur Road, often used for time trials, or around Babler State Park which has some of the infamous Babler Beast climb with two different loop options to get you around the park with a bit of variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wildhorse Creek road is a popular cycling route, connecting over to Ossenfort for a climb up towards Highway T and ultimately connecting over to Melrose. From Melrose you can easily get to Greensfelder park, or take another climb up through Rockwood Reservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to beautiful roads Wildwood has miles and miles of paved multi-use trails that get you around the city safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gravel-grinding&quot;&gt;Gravel Grinding&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Wildwood has grown up, more and more pavement has replaced gravel around the city, but there are still a number of options if you’re looking to scratch your gravel itch. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gorctrails.com/trails/al-foster-trail&quot;&gt;Al Foster&lt;/a&gt; is a great local trail, but if you really want to ride gravel your best bet is to park at the LeCave trailhead down on Centaur Road and ride ~4 miles over to the Katy Trail in St. Charles County. From LeCave you can ride about 9 miles (west on the Katy) to the Hamburg trail and get a nice gravel climb up into Busch Wildlife where you can find miles and miles of gravel roads and loops to ride around on.&lt;/p&gt;
