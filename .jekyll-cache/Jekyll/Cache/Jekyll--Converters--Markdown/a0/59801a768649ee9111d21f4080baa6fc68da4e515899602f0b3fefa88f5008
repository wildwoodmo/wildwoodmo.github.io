I"M<p>There is one movie theater in Wildwood Missouri, and based on poor customer service experiences with B&amp;B Theaters in Wildwood, it is not our recommendation that you patronize their theater.</p>

<p>If you purchase tickets for a movie online, you will be charged a service fee. If that movie is for some reason cancelled, they will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not inform you ahead of time.</li>
  <li>Not refund you the full price you paid for the tickets and the service fee.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck getting B&amp;B Theaters to respond to you either. While they might actually respond to a “review” posted on Google Maps ratings, they won’t go any further than that.</p>

<p>Whenever you walk into the B&amp;B Theaters in Wildwood, Missouri you are just about guaranteed to walk into a smokey (burnt popcorn) room with very poor customer service being provided.</p>

<p>Please avoid the B&amp;B Theaters in Wildwood.</p>
