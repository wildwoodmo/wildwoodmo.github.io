There is one movie theater in Wildwood Missouri, and based on poor customer service experiences with B&B Theaters in Wildwood, it is not our recommendation that you patronize the theaters.

If you purchase tickets for a movie online, you will be charged a service fee. If that movie is for some reason cancelled, they will:
- Not inform you ahead of time.
- Not refund you the full price you paid for the tickets and the service fee.

Good luck getting B&B Theaters to respond to you either. While they might actually respond to a "review" posted on Google Maps ratings, they won't go any further than that. 

## Please check out one of these theaters close to Wildwood:

[AMC Chesterfield 14 located in the Chesterfield Mall](https://www.amctheatres.com/movie-theatres/st-louis/amc-classic-chesterfield-14)

[Marcus Theaters in Chesterfield, Missouri](https://www.marcustheatres.com/theatre-locations/marcus-chesterfield-galaxy-14-mega)

Whenever you walk into the B&B Theaters in Wildwood, Missouri you are just about guaranteed to walk into a smokey (burnt popcorn) room with very poor customer service being provided.

Please avoid the B&B Theaters in Wildwood.
