The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) has unveiled plans for a significant infrastructure project aimed at enhancing traffic flow and safety in St. Louis County. Central to this initiative is the construction of a two-lane roundabout at the bustling intersection of Route 109 and Route CC. This development comes in response to the area's growth and the resulting increase in traffic congestion.

## The Choice of a Roundabout

Roundabouts are celebrated for their efficiency and safety benefits. By reducing conflict points and encouraging a continuous flow of traffic, they significantly lower the chances of accidents while easing vehicle movement.

## Anticipated Community Benefits

The project is expected to yield numerous advantages:

- **Reduced Travel Times:** Streamlining the flow of traffic to minimize delays.
- **Lower Vehicle Emissions:** Less idling means a decrease in exhaust emissions.
- **Enhanced Safety:** A safer environment for motorists and pedestrians alike.

## Embracing the Future

Scheduled to begin in Spring 2024, the construction phase will undoubtedly introduce temporary changes to daily commutes. However, the focus remains on the long-term gains: a more efficient, safer, and environmentally friendly transportation network.
