If you're looking for places to ride your bike near St. Louis, you will be hard pressed to find a better area for all types of riding than Wildwood, Missouri.

# Mountain Biking
Some of the best mountain biking in the St. Louis area can be found right here in Wildwood. Be sure to visit (Bluff View, Zombie, Rock Hollow)[https://gorctrails.com/trails/bluff-view], (Greensfelder)[https://gorctrails.com/trails/greensfelder].

GORC (Gateway Off-road Cyclists) has really put in a lot of effort into the park at Bluff View and is currently building out new trails and kids trails there as well. 

# Road Cycling
If you're looking for beautiful roads to ride your road or tri bike on, Wildwood is the place for you! We've got plenty of hills with climbs to earn your descents. You can easily get one thousand feed of climbing in with a 10 mile route or even more climbing for longer routes as well.

Some of the safest places to ride your road bike include Centaur Road, often used for time trials, or around Babler State Park which has some of the infamous Babler Beast climb with two different loop options to get you around the park with a bit of variety.

Wildhorse Creek road is a popular cycling route, connecting over to Ossenfort for a climb up towards Highway T and ultimately connecting over to Melrose. From Melrose you can easily get to Greensfelder park, or take another climb up through Rockwood Reservation.

In addition to beautiful roads Wildwood has miles and miles of paved multi-use trails that get you around the city safely. 


# Gravel Grinding
As Wildwood has grown up, more and more pavement has replaced gravel around the city, but there are still a number of options if you're looking to scratch your gravel itch. The (Al Foster)[https://gorctrails.com/trails/al-foster-trail] is a great local trail, but if you really want to ride gravel your best bet is to park at the LeCave trailhead down on Centaur Road and ride ~4 miles over to the Katy Trail in St. Charles County. From LeCave you can ride about 9 miles (west on the Katy) to the Hamburg trail and get a nice gravel climb up into Busch Wildlife where you can find miles and miles of gravel roads and loops to ride around on.
